# Arabic Mac Keyboard Layout for Windows Keyboards

This repository contains a custom keyboard layout configuration for Karabiner-Elements, designed to make a Windows keyboard with Arabic characters behave more like a Mac keyboard when used on macOS. This can be particularly useful for users who are accustomed to the Mac Arabic keyboard layout but are using a Windows keyboard, such as those from Logitech.

## Installation

1. Install [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) on your macOS device.
2. Clone this repository or download the `arabic-mac-layout.json` file.
3. Import the configuration into Karabiner-Elements:
   - Open Karabiner-Elements.
   - Go to the "Complex Modifications" tab.
   - Click "Add rule" at the bottom left.
   - Click "Import more rules from the Internet (open a web browser)".
   - Find the downloaded `arabic-mac-layout.json` file and select it.
   - Click "Import" and then "Enable" for the rule you wish to activate.

## Supported Modifications

This layout includes modifications to make the following keys on a Windows keyboard behave like their counterparts on a Mac keyboard when using the Arabic input source:

- `]` -> `v`
- `'` -> `x`
- `` ` `` -> `c`
- `/` -> `z`
- `.` -> `b`
- `,` -> `m`
- `m` -> `]`
- `n` -> `d` + `shift`
- `b` -> `g` then `h`
- `v` -> `n`
- `c` -> `m` + `shift`
